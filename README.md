Description: this weather dashboard allows the user to search the current weather and 5 day forecast the city they search for.

Usage: Users can type their city of interest in the search box. After searching, today's weather will appear in a large box. The five day forecast appears below the current weather in individual boxes. During their search, a gray button with the city's name will appear in the left hand column for each search term. This button allows users to see the weather at cities they've already searched for during the session without having to use the search box again.
